FIX THIS =

Image contrast:  https://css-tricks.com/methods-contrasting-text-backgrounds/

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter-function/contrast

join us page on mobile view is screwed up.  the button isn' t placed right

Board & Paul page on mobile view height is too much compared to about page. 


On about and every page, the top image should have the text readable.  the brightness or something needs to be fixed. 


fix the main divs under home page - construct row 
copy the construct code for bottom ones. implemtn the order then


Trail class for about and paul page.  if one works other dont. 

Make the hamburger btn on right white. 


In about us (all) pages, the min height should be min-height: 600px for md view, not for other views.
This can be fixed by creaing a custom class.
