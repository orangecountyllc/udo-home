WHY DO I work & bring clients  on the platform and loose my clients ?

Youre not loosing your clients but youre benefitting from the other riders/ clients on the platform, your clients are always going to call you first if youre available, if not they can depend on other dependable clients.

ask grok : 
help me write a backstory of my birdy app, make it feel genuine:   It started when i had to move to a large metro city & for the first time i ddint felt the need to keep my car around because I was so sick of either getting a lot of traffice or parking violations  tickets and i just had it enough, the city would invent new ways to fine me,  and I ultimtelay  had to ditch my car. So i started using more rideshare apps, back in california my uncle Tony has a limo company & he is a very happy man but my expeirnece after meeting with a lot of rideshare drivers was not compared to that. Since i was over and over being faced with the issue and I did my research by talking to more drivers then i actually rode on few of the rideshare apps and quickly found out what I was paying for my rides and how much I was receiving as a driver who is working for hours a day. The situation wasn't looking good.    I quickly leanred that private drivers or limo drivers were able to live comfortably because they received most of the money that customer pays to the drivers but most riders and drivers didnt know about the concept of private drivers where the driver goes above and beyond , where the relationship is real and a genuine care for the customer because he is helping me put food on the table.   Secondly as a driver i learned that for of the females safety was the number one concern, some drivers have been rude to them and yadi yadi.  Other day one of my driver friends who is in his 60s was asking me, my client wants to tip me money but I dont know how to recieve the money, I was like you should have zelle and i have also had that situation where i wanted to exchange info with my clients and a lot of them wouldnt want to share their personal number but there wasn't a choice.   Thats how i was able to connect the dots,  and caome up with the idea of digital card that also shows my  location to my clients.  So they know where I am in the city adn if i will be able to pick them on time.. Also when you first want to connect with a driver to choose with as your private driver you , just one ride with him wasn't enough to know enough about him.   So this way drivers can add more information about themselves that build trust among his/her riders  on my digital card.     Also since as a rider you already know the guy you are picking up, so your trust on that  guy is even more, since you have already spend 20-30 minutes.  Wont it be cool to ride with him again ? Bc as a female rider they dont have to stress / anxiety about who is this random driver ?         Boom  that was the game changer all dots connected.  This led me to start this thing.         I know the people who use rideshare apps regularly or just once a week woudl be able to relate to me.              Wait I'll also tell you how the came up wiht the name birdy.  so I tinkered with name freedom, bc it signifies freedom  Freedom for both riders and drivers ,  freedom from low pay, freeom from anxiety over random drivers.  But the name freedom had political connotations and it wasn't catch you say, let me call a freedom app ?  so then i came up wiht  the name  'free birds'   and i knew people wanna use one word, then  bird also means a helicopter   I tlekd to more and more peole they sayd Birdie is cute.  I'd use birdy.    Feel free to ask any questions.  Reach me at jay@birdyone.com

The primary reason why you dont have best customer service with ride shaer is bc the driver isnt  getting paid enough. 


If turned on - App automatically send the vehicle info to ur parents /  friends 
if you have not reached the destination within specific time... 
ur friends get all the location tracking  live and after  drive is finished!!! 

Parents can motior the live app. ie location etc.


> Allow feature for women to drop them off a block away from their destination. 
So dont show the house number to the drivers. 

OUR APP tracks if the driver's  hasn't driven away or he is staynig there, and even ask the driver to move away!!!! 

> Say on website most of our drivers are UBer / Lyft drivers who have min 10 years of experience.  Wiht us they are happy make more money. 

> If the riders who proivde their ID to the platform we will prioritize those rides bc our drivers will feel safe!!!!  ( Maybe add this feature LATER )
