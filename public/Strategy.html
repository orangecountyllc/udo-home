      <p class="plansHero__subtitle_left"> I’m not sure “Freedom” is the best name. It’s not very catchy or easy to build a community around—like “Amazonians” for Amazon. “Freedomers” doesn’t really work.
        Since we’ll have standout features like alerts (similar to Waze), a strong name that’s simple and natural to say could really help it stick.
        What do you think? </p>

      <br><br>
        <p style="color: blue;" class="plansHero__subtitle_left"> > Now I am thinking of name : Free Birds, & slowly people will start calling the 
          drivers as Bird,   Just like people say ‘Ubering,’ even when they are lyfting, ( lol ) younger users could say ‘I’m birding’ or ‘Let me call a bird.’, Or my bird will be here soon. 
          
          >I am getting a bird. Just get a bird. <br>  Bird signifies freedom (from uber). Emotional Resonance: The name taps into a universal desire for liberation, especially for drivers frustrated with Uber/Lyft’s high commissions and rigid systems.
        & its uplifting.   
        <br><br>
     > The best part is I was looking for a name that is short that can be used in the cars (govt require it), in this case we can use just the symbol bird.  
    
      <br><br>
        >But there is another name registered with Bird — Ride Electric.  We'll figure it out. 

        <br><br>
        
        > I spoke to a few riders—they liked the name “Fee Bird” or “Free Birds. or  "Happy Birds"  OR  Birdie ( ppl say it sounds cute) ” Just wondering, should it be “Free Bird” or “Free Birds”?
    </p>
    <br><br><br><br>
      <p class="plansHero__subtitle_left"> >There are many drivers in other states/cities looking for a service like this.  </p>
      <br><br>
      <p class="plansHero__subtitle_left"> >I think our strategy should be to get them ( riders + drivers ) to sign up early, so when we launch, we already have 200 drivers or 100 riders ready to go.</p>
      <br><br>
      <p class="plansHero__subtitle_left"> >Our focus should be on building a strong foundation for success, not just short-term revenue. </p>
      <br><br>
      
      <p class="plansHero__subtitle_left">
       >  I was starting to think DC might be too saturated and considered launching in NY instead. But a rider pointed out that DC Metro riders could be a great target audience—they often use the Metro, Uber, or Empower daily. Many of them aren’t even aware of Empower, likely because it doesn’t market much. A strong slogan like “Did you know your Uber driver only gets 50% of what you pay?” could really resonate here, especially since people in DC and NY often like supporting local drivers and small businesses.
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <p class="plansHero__subtitle_left">
      >  I know there are many Facebook groups where moms connect—we should definitely tap into that market. The question is, what’s the right incentive to offer them?
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <p class="plansHero__subtitle_left">
        > I believe community involvement could drive a lot of referrals—I’m just not sure how to tap into it effectively.
      </p>
      <br><br> <br>

      <p class="plansHero__subtitle_left">
       > We need attract riders (& drivers ) before launch—otherwise, drivers won’t be motivated, especially if there’s no demand to justify the cost of commercial insurance.  
      </p>

      <p class="plansHero__subtitle_left"> Let’s think about how apps like these went viral and apply similar ideas.    
      </p>

      <br>
      <p class="plansHero__subtitle_left">
        > I’m not fully sure about <b>pricing</b> yet. We could do $1 per mile or minute, but downtown rates might be higher due to traffic and demand. For now, we can say we charge 10% less than Uber. When the VO arrives, they can check the Uber price, and we’ll honor it with a 10% discount—no questions asked. We trust our VOs.  
      </p>
      <br><br>

      <p class="plansHero__subtitle_left">   Maybe we should consider <b> different pricing for different areas.</b> 
        
        In DC, Empower has taken over by offering super low prices—even though it’s technically illegal and doesn’t offer insurance. 
        
        Most people don’t realize that, and it puts us at a disadvantage unless we can match their pricing.
         </p>
        <br><br>
        
        
      <p style="color:blue" class="plansHero__subtitle_left"> 
       > Let’s be mindful not to give all incentives upfront—this keeps VOs motivated and allows room for future rewards. 
       <br><br>
       Also, we need to ensure our system works well for both VOs and riders from the start, since we won’t be able to change it easily later.

       
      </p>


      <p style="" class="plansHero__subtitle_left">  
        <br><br>
       > In my research I found the Empower platform could improve its pricing strategy. For example, an Uber ride from Silver Spring, MD to Ronald Reagan Airport (10mi) costs around $40, but Empower charges only $25. While the owner claims to be driver-friendly, it seems like he’s prioritizing customer satisfaction over the drivers. As a result, drivers are earning very little despite working long hours to make just $200.
        <br><br>
Somebody told me, the best strategy for drivers is to stay within the northwest part of DC, where you earn around $10 for every 2 miles. However, I feel Empower’s pricing model, technology, is outdated, and the owner isn’t keeping up with changes in the market which is great for us to enter into the market.

<br><br>
If Empower doesn’t make this change, we could take that approach, but the challenge is that customers may still flock to Empower because of its low prices. I think we can start by offering a lower fee for our drivers and then gradually increase our prices to about 10% less than what Uber charges. Once drivers see they’re getting paid more here with our pay-as-you-go model, they will likely prefer our platform.


Fewer drivers will pick up customers due to low pay, leading to poor service. As a result, customers will turn to our service, which is still 10% cheaper than Uber.

  <h2>🔧 Suggestions to Strengthen Your Viral Strategy</h2>

  <h3>1. Launch with Community Champions (Ambassadors)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Recruit driver and rider ambassadors in each city.</li>
    <li>Offer perks (swag, waived fees, exclusive access) in exchange for helping onboard others.</li>
    <li>Use tools like WhatsApp/Telegram groups to build local momentum.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2. Create a Waitlist with Visibility</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Like Robinhood,  <u>show users how close they are to getting access. </u></li>
    <li style="color: blue;" >Refer more to move up” can increase viral spread.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3. Partner with Facebook Groups / Reddit Communities</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Target: rideshare drivers (Uber subreddits, FB groups), moms (for family booking), <span style="color: blue;"> college students.  ( how - they only want cheap/ free </span></li>
    <li>Offer special codes to group members with public leaderboards.  ( ? How does that help ? ) </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>4. Time-Limited Referral Multipliers</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>For the first 2–4 weeks: “Every referral counts as 2.”</li>
    <li>Or: “Refer 5 in 5 days, get $25 in ride credits.”</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>5. Make it About “Taking Back Control”</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Market to drivers as a driver liberation movement (freedom from Uber fees).</li>
    <li>Use storytelling from real drivers (maybe even TikToks or reels).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>6. Launch Campaign Theme</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Example: “Freedom Week” → city-wide countdown to unlock launch.</li>
    <li>Post daily signup updates to create FOMO. <span style="color: blue;">  ( fear of missing out ) </span> </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>7. Memes and Shareable Content</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Create a meme/social toolkit for drivers and riders to share.</li>
    <li>Think funny comparisons of Uber vs Freedom App (fees, tips, etc.).</li>
  </ul>
